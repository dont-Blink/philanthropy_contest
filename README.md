## Step 1 - Install dependencies
You will need Python 3, selenium, Chrome, and the selenium Chrome driver for this code to work

pip install selenium

If you're in PyCharm and getting the error that selenium cannot be found: File->Settings->Project->Project Interpreter->hit the little plus->search for Selenium->install it

For selenium Chrome driver:
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
*note that you may need to add the driver to your PATH

For troubleshooting:
https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

## Step 2 - Modify script
In line 17, replace username_here with your username

In line 18, replace password_here with your password

*note that it is recommended you create a throwaway instagram in case your account gets banned

## Step 3 - Run script
Go to your command line and navigate to the script

Then type python3 script3.py
